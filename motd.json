What this means is that future updates will simply be compatibility updates if the piping changes, but no new features will be added. Also these support updates will not be released in a timely matter, or in sync with FVTT's updates. If an update breaks theatre functionality, it may be weeks before I patch it. (v1.0.3) will be the last version to receive new features.</p></section>",
